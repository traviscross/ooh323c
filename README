Objective Open H.323 README

Introduction

Thank you for downloading the Objective Open H.323 software. This
package contains a simple H.323 stack developed in C.  The ASN.1
messaging code was developed using the Objective Systems ASN1C
compiler to implement the H.225, H.245, and H.450 specifications. 
Then additional code was developed which makes use of the compiler
generated code for presenting a comparatively high level stack API.

The media part, which includes RTP and audio support, is implemented
as a sample library. The media library uses G.711 code made available
by Sun Microsystems to the open source community. Please refer to their
license for more details.

Features supported in this package include the following:

1. At the H.225 level, the framework allows the exchange of basic
   Q.931 signalling messages for call setup. Also, fastStart and
   H.245 tunneling is supported.

2. At the H.245 level, the following messages are supported
 -   MasterSlaveDetermination
 -   MasterSlaveDeterminationAck
 -   TerminalCapabilitySet
 -   TerminalCapabilitySetAck
 -   OpenLogicalChannel
 -   OpenLogicalChannelAck
 -   CloseLogicalChannel
 -   CloseLogicalChannelAck
 -   RequestChannelClose
 -   RequestChannelCloseAck

   Note that "supported" means that these items have a sample
   implementation. However, other message types such as RAS can be
   easily supported by following the same implementation pattern.

3. The stack also supports RAS messages such as GateKeeperRequest,
   RegistrationRequest, AdmissionRequest and DisengageRequest and
   corresponding responses.

4. Objective systems has provided a sample media library which can
   send/receive RTP data. It can also play the received audio onto
   speakers and can collect audio from Mic for transmitting as rtp
   stream. Apart from this, it also supports transmitting audio files
   over RTP channel. The windows version supports 16 bit, 8000 samples
   per second wave file where as linux version supports raw 16 bit audio
   data file.

5. Sample H.323 based audio file player and receiver programs are
   provided with this package.

6. This package also contains a sample H.323 VoIP phone application
   which opens g711ulaw64k channels and transmits and receives voice.
   It is tested successfully against ohPhone, a widely used open source
   H.323 phone application.


Getting Started
   This section describes how to build the complete package on linux and
   windows systems respectively.
  
   Building on Linux:
   ------------------
 
   1. Change directory to package root directory
      ooh323c-x.y. (x.y indicate the release version of the stack)

   2. To generate make files:

         >./configure --prefix=<install-dir>

      The configure script will generate the requred makefiles. The
      <install-dir> is where the libraries will be installed. By default
      the libraries are installed in /usr/local/lib. The static and shared
      versions of h323 stack library(liboostk) and media plug-in library
      (liboomedia) are installed.


   3. To build the complete mackage, run makefile in the package root directory,
      ooh323c-x.y
         >make
      This will build all the libraries and sample applications.
  
      To build optimized version:
         >make opt 

      To build debug version:
         >make debug

   4. To install libraries, from package root directory run

         >make install

   5. To run examples, make sure that all the libraries(liboostk.a,
      liboomedia.so) are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The libraries are located
      in <install-dir>/lib directory.

      Now run the receiver from command prompt:
  
        >./ooReceiver
  
      A log file will be created in the ooh323c-x.y/tests/receiver
      directory (ooReceiver.log). Also, the log file for the media plugin will
      be created in the same directory (media.log).

     Now run the player from command prompt:
  
        >./ooPlayer space.raw
   
      A log file will be created in the ooh323c-x.y/tests/player
      directory (ooPlayer.log). Also, a log file for the media plug-in will be
      created in the same directory (media.log).

   6. To run the H.323 endpoint sample application:
      Make sure all the libraries(liboostk.a, liboomedia.so) are in your
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH path. The libraries are located in <install-dir>/lib
      directory.

      To run the telephony application:
      From package root directory ooh323c-x.y
         >cd tests/simple
        
      To make a call:
         >./simple <dest-ip:port>
      where <dest-ip> is the dotted representation of the destinations IP
      address.
     
      To receive a call:
         >./simple

      You will find simple.log and media.log in the current directory.
     

   7. For testing against ohphone, make sure -n option for ohphone
      is enabled. If you want to use gatekeeper, you will have to enable
      the gatekeeper mode in simple.c


   Building on Windows
   -------------------

   The package includes Visual Studio 6 based workspace and project files.

   1. Open the package root directory ooh323c-x.y, where x.y indicate the
      release number.
  
   2. Open the ooh323c.dsw workspace which includes all the projects within
      the package.

   3. You can now do a batch build to build the complete package.

   4. To build individual projects, dependencies are as follows:
      oostk.dsp - none
      oomedia.dsp - none
      simple.dsp - oostk.dsp, oomedia.dsp
      ooPlayer.dsp - oostk.dsp, oomedia.dsp
      ooReceiver.dsp - oostk.dsp, oomedia.dsp

   5. After a successful build the libraries will be installed in
      ooh323c-x.y\lib\release and ooh323c-x.y\lib\debug directories.

   6. To run examples, make sure that the media plug-in library oomedia.dll
      is in your PATH. The libraries is located in
      ooh323c-x.y\lib\release and  ooh323c-x.y\lib\debug directories.

      Now run the receiver from command prompt:
      From package root directory ooh323c-x.y

        >cd tests\receiver\Release
        >ooReceiver.exe
  
      A log file will be created in the current directory (ooReceiver.log).
      Also, a log file for the media plugin will be created in the same
      directory (media.log).

      Now run the player from command prompt:
      From package root directory ooh323c-x.y
         >cd tests\player\Release
         >ooPlayer.exe states.WAV
   
      A log file will be created in the current directory (ooReceiver.log).
      Also, a log file for the media plugin will be created in the same
      directory (media.log).
  
   7. To run the sample telephony endpoint application, again ensure that
      the media plug-in library oomedia.dll is in your PATH. The library
      is located in ooh323c-x.y\lib\release and  ooh323c-x.y\lib\debug
      directories.      
     
      To run the telephony application:
      From package root directory ooh323c-x.y
         >cd tests\simple\Release
        
      To make a call:
         >simple <dest-ip>
      where <dest-ip> is the dotted representation of the destinations IP
      address.
     
      To receive a call:
         >simple.exe

      You will find simple.log and media.log in the current directory.

   8. For testing against ohphone, make sure -n option for ohphone
      is enabled. If you want to use gatekeeper, you will have to enable
      the gatekeeper support in simple.c.
          next release.
